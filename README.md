Experiment Protocol for HiLoResSTM2 Study

# Version 1.0 Notes

Tasks: Gabor, STM, Perception

## Gabor

Study a Gabor 

## Short Term Memory

Design includes three crossed factors: 
1. Group (Patients vs. Healthy Controls)
2. Resolution (High vs. Low)
3. Complexity (Low-Set Size 2 vs. High-Set Size 4)

Participants will study intermixed lists of trials drawn from the combination of the Resolution by Complexity factors. 
If a set size of 2 (low Complexity), the two trial-unique objects will be presented stacked (one on top, one of bottom), offset
+/- 100 pixels in the y-dimension from center. If set size 4, the four objects will be presented in four quadrants of a grid 
defined by x- and y-offsets of +/- 100 pixels (all four possible combinations). The objects are rotated


Each image set is studied for 3 seconds, and 
followed by a 1 second study-test delay. At test, each image is presented
